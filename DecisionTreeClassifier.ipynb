    "# Decision Tree Classifiers By Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are one of the most intuitive algorithms in machine learning. They are commonly used for classification problems. These are problems where the goal is to assign labels to data, such as predicting if an email is spam, whether a customer will leave, or if a loan application should be approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will explore how [SciKit Learn's Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) can be used to solve classification type problems by trying to predict survivors of Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Decision Trees Work\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree works like a flowchart.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each node asks a question about a feature (for example, \"Is the passenger female?\").\n",
    "- Based on the answer, the data follows a branch to the next question.\n",
    "- Eventually, the data reaches a leaf node, which represents the predicted class (such as \"Survived\" or \"Did not survive\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The important part is that machine learning is used to build this flowchart automatically.\n",
    "Instead of manually deciding which questions to ask and in what order, we train the model using labeled data. The algorithm looks at patterns in the data and figures out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which features are the most informative,\n",
    "- What threshold values best separate different groups,\n",
    "- And how to organize these decisions in a way that leads to accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes decision trees both powerful and easy to understand. You can trace exactly how a prediction was made by following the tree's logic.\n",

    "## Data Wrangling \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and machine learning, variables are generally divided into two main types: **categorical** and **continuous**. Understanding the difference between these types is essential, because they are handled differently during data preprocessing and model training. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical variables** are features that represent distinct groups or labels. Examples include gender (`male`, `female`), passenger class (`first`, `second`, `third`), or port of embarkation (`C`, `Q`, `S`). These variables describe qualitative attributes and do not have a meaningful numeric order or scale. In contrast, **continuous variables** represent quantitative data. They include values such as age, fare, or temperature that can take on a wide range of numerical values and support arithmetic operations like averaging and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciKit Learn's [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) does not support categorical variables (see: [#5442](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5442)). We therefore need to convert categorical variables into a suitable format. One of the most common techniques for this is **one-hot encoding**, which transforms each unique category into its own binary (0 or 1) column. For example, a `Sex` column with the values `male` and `female` would be split into two new columns: `Sex_male` and `Sex_female`. Each row would have a 1 in the column that matches the category and a 0 in the other. This allows models to use categorical information without treating the values as numeric or ordered, and avoids introducing unintended relationships between categories.\n",

    "### Splitting the data into training and validation data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a machine learning model, it's important to test how well it performs on new, unseen data and not just the data it was trained on. This helps us understand whether the model is actually learning meaningful patterns, or simply memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we split the dataset into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training set: This is the portion of the data the model uses to learn. It sees the input features and corresponding labels, and uses them to build internal rulesâ€”like how to split the decision tree.\n",
    "- Validation set (sometimes called a test set): This is a separate portion of the data that the model does not see during training. After the model is trained, we use the validation set to evaluate how well it performs on data it hasn't encountered before.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This split helps prevent overfitting, which happens when a model performs very well on the training data but poorly on new data. By testing on a validation set, we get a more realistic measure of how well our model is likely to perform in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we split data into training and validation sets, we want each set to be a **fair representation** of the full dataset. This is especially important when it comes to the **target label** we are trying to predict. Stratification helps ensure that the distribution of this label is consistent across both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Titanic dataset, the target label is `Survived`, which tells us whether a passenger lived or died. This dataset is imbalanced because more passengers died than survived. If we split the data randomly, we might end up with a training set that contains mostly non-survivors or a validation set with very few survivors. This imbalance can distort how the model learns and lead to unreliable performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified sampling helps solve this problem by preserving the proportion of classes in each split. For example, if about 38% of passengers survived in the full dataset, stratification ensures that the training and validation sets also contain approximately 38% survivors. This makes sure the model is trained and tested on data that reflects the true class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scikit-Learn, we can use the stratify parameter in the `train_test_split()` function to enable this behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how it looks when we split the data so that we have 80% training data and 20% validation data (`test_size=0.2`), stratify the data using the `Survived` column, and set the `random_state` to a fixed value (so that every time we run the code, we get the same split):"

In a binary classification problem like predicting Titanic survival (`Survived = 0` or `1`), a random guess would mean selecting either class with equal probability. This is similar to flipping a coin, which gives an expected accuracy of around 50%.\n",
